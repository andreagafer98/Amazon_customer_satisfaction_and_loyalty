# Amazon_customer_satisfaction_and_loyalty

  Technological advancements over the last few years have transformed the way people buy and sell goods. Increased access to internet connection and affordable devices have lowered the barriers to online shopping and allowed customers to profit from online transactions. As a consequence, e-commerce has become a crucial component of the retail industry.

  Due to the competitiveness of the online retail industry environment, businesses must successfully develop strategies to retain existing customers and attract new ones to stay on top of the market. One way to measure and improve customer retention is through customer loyalty. Those customers who trust a brand and tend to go back to the same one for future purchases, are also defined as loyal customers. Thus, loyal customers can be considered an asset to any firm and are a leading indicator of future profits.

  The focus company of this study, Amazon, has established itself as the leading online retailer, owning 37.7% of the U.S. market share. Its mission, “to be Earth’s most customer-centric company”, has helped the company to build a strong customer base and enjoy high rates of customer satisfaction and loyalty. In order to continue to expand its customer base and maintain its leading position within the industry, Amazon must investigate the factors that influence customer loyalty.

  Existing research has found that one of the key factors for every company wishing to increase customer loyalty is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is a measurement that determines the overall customer experience with a company’s products or services. Building upon this insight, the research question of this study is raised: does customer satisfaction contribute to increased loyalty among Amazon customers? Thus, by studying the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty, the researcher will gain a deeper understanding of how one variable influences the other one.

Key findings:

- Both perceived value and customer satisfaction have a positive and statitically significant impact on loyalty.
-  Prime Members are 14 % more likely to recommend Amazon to friends and family
- 98% of participants are very satisfied or satisfied with their overall shopping experience
